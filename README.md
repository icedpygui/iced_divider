## Easy to Use

* Using a stack, place the dividers(s) over your containers.
* Use the value of the divider to place the handle over the edge of the container.
* Resize the containers using the return message when the handle is moved.
* The message routine is simple, see examples, and is esssentially the same for all situations.
* Make a table easily, you have full control of the content and styling.
* Tables can have headers or footers, no restrictions.
